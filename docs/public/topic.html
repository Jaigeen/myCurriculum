                <h2>Porsche 911</h2>
                <p>It is the first jewel that Moses acquired. This German car is painted in discreet tones for everyday use. The Porsche 911 is a timeless sports car with its signature rear-engine layout and breathtaking performance. With over 50 years of heritage, the 911 balances luxury and speed like no other.</p>

                <h2>Ford Mustang</h2>
                <p>The mustang is the quintessential Moses car. It has over 120 horsepower, and although it recently almost ran out of a rearview mirror, it remains Moses' most prized car (on a personal level). The Ford Mustang is an American classic, known for its muscular V8 engine and bold, aggressive design. A true symbol of freedom and raw power on the road.</p>

                <img src="../images/mercedes.jpg ">
                <h2>Mercedes class A</h2>
                <p>When you have an elegant dinner, what less than a Mercedes A class with everything equipped to show elegance. Moises uses this car for the AI conferences he holds in Spain.</p>

                <h2>Lamborghini Urus</h2>
                <p>Lamborghini Urus is the first Super Sport Utility Vehicle in the world. With extreme proportions, breathtaking design, extraordinary driving dynamics and heart-pounding performance, for Moisés, Urus represents freedom in its quintessential state, one of his favourites cars.</p>

                <h2>Fiat 500</h2>
                <p>Moises uses this car to go to work, because it is discreet and goes unnoticed in the crowd. It is here because of his daily use to camouflage himself in the crowd. </p>

                <img src="../images/alfaRomeo.jpg">
                <h2>Alfa Romeo Giulia Sprint GTA</h2>
                <p>To conclude, we come across a gift from Moses' father when, at the age of 19, he started working at ESA (he already completed a PhD). The Alfa Romeo Giulia Sprint GTA is a masterpiece of 1960s engineering, featuring a lightweight aluminum body and a high-revving twin-cam engine. It's a true symbol of Italian passion and racing heritage.</p>

                <img src="../images/Tesla.jpg">
                <h2>tesla model 3</h2>
                <p>Ancient legends tell that Moses had a red Tesla model 3, but he didn't like it (it looked more like a washing machine than a car), maybe because of the lack of sound when the engine was running.</p>
