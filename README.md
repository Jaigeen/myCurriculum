1- All files created. 
2- Styles for the index and about section created. 
3- Index created.
4- About section finished.  
5- Styles for contact section created. 
6- Contact section finished. 
7- Styles for garage topic created. 
8- Topic section finished. 
9- Degree and first year finished. As degree depends on its internal subgroups, I have decided to commit both at the same time so that the changes fit together. 
10- Since the other courses contain practically the same code, I have reused the first year's code for the others. That is why I have committed all three html files at the same time. 
11- Second, third and fourth year done! 
12- Fundamentals section done.
13- Net section done. 
14- I've done some upgrades in order to obtain more grade.

To start the project, the first thing I did was to link my online github with the physical repository, which I created with git bash. Once linked, I created the docs folder, the index.html, all the html in the public folder, as well as the public folder, and the images and css folder, in which I created the styles.css file to introduce all the styles that I have been creating along the project. 

Then I got my first error: when I made the first commit, it gave me an error for two reasons: I had not created a Branch, nor had I linked what I was doing with any repository. I also had a problem when I opened the README, since it gave me an error, since it was inside the docs folder, and the README is outside that folder.


I began the project creating the header, the footer, and the styles that I used at first in index, although later I was reusing them in other sections. So far everything was going well, until I realized that in the first two commits I forgot to add the docs folder, so the only thing that changes between the first two commits is the README. However, in the third commit I have already created all the indexes, but I have only edited the index, the others are empty, following the job request.  

I continued doing the about part. This part started giving me problems since the styles were not being applied. The main problem is that I was adding the css/styles.css folder directly, but that folder is not at the same level, but at a higher level, so the correct way is the following: ../css/styles.css. I had to create a new style on the images in order to have the images centered (in the index the images are on the sides). 

The Contact part cost me a lot more than it seems, because I thought it had to work for real, and I went crazy. However, my colleagues quickly solved my doubt and it was much easier for me. The complexity was in the Contact styles. With the help of the display flex and the margins, I managed to get everything perfect, just the way I wanted it. In fact, in this very commit I had to redo a part of the contact because it does not work when applying the button once I have published the page. 


The topic section I had thought for months how I wanted to do it. I had a hard time squaring the images inside the boxes, but finally I managed to do it, using the hovers that my brother taught me. 


The whole degree part did not require a high complexity of styles, but it was very long; it requires a lot of content that you have to structure well in order for the links to work, as well as for the styles to be applied. To organize it better, I created a folder called degree and within metro the four years and the fundamentals, the latter only accessible from the first year. 

In reality, the work is much longer and more complex than it seems. You have to spend many hours creating files, editing styles to make them fit in the pages, updating all the pages so that the links work correctly. I really liked the practice because I consider that it encompasses all the basic concepts to start getting familiar with the development of web pages. Really, it is necessary to put hours and desire to take this project forward. 

Although I did not do the activity IV, it is very useful to perform later the fundamentals part. Manuel Amor√≥s recommended it to me and I found it very useful. All the previous activities are essential if you want to make a good PWII, so I consider that the course is very well developed.
